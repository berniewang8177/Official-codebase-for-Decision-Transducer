# Official-codebase-for-Decision-Transducer
This is the pytorch implementation of the UAI2023 paper  "A Trajectory is Worth Three Sentences: Multimodal Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning"

## Overview
This repo contains full implementation of a multimodal transformer: Decision Transducer. It was designed to improve transformers performance on offline RL, by disentangling the complicated interactions between modalities (state, action, return/goal).
